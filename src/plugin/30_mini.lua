--   cursor in current buffer. Useful for a detailed exploration.

-- Text edit operators. All operators have mappings for:
-- - Regular operator (waits for motion/textobject to use)
-- - Current line action (repeat second character of operator to activate)
-- - Act on visual selection (type operator in Visual mode)
--
-- Example usage:
-- - `griw` - replace (`gr`) *i*inside *w*ord
-- - `gmm` - multiple/duplicate (`gm`) current line (extra `m`)
-- - `vipgs` - *v*isually select *i*nside *p*aragraph and sort it (`gs`)
-- - `gxiww.` - exchange (`gx`) *i*nside *w*ord with next word (`w` to navigate
--   to it and `.` to repeat exchange operator)
-- - `g==` - execute current line as Lua code and replace with its output.
--   For example, typing `g==` over line `vim.lsp.get_clients()` shows
--   information about all available LSP clients.

  -- - Relies on `a` argument textobject from 'mini.ai'.

  -- - It overrides `:h (` and `:h )`.
  -- Explanation: `gx`-`ia`-`gx`-`ila` <=> exchange current and last argument
  -- Usage: when on `a` in `(aa, bb)` press `)` followed by `(`.

-- Pick anything with single window layout and fast matching. This is one of
-- the main usability improvements as it powers a lot of "find things quickly"
-- workflows. How to use a picker:
-- - Start picker, usually with `:Pick <picker-name>` command. Like `:Pick files`.
--   It shows a single window in the bottom left corner filled with possible items
--   to choose from. Current item has special full line highlighting.
--   At the top there is a current query used to filter+sort items.
-- - Type characters (appear at top) to narrow down items. There is fuzzy matching:
--   characters may not match one-by-one, but they should be in correct order.
-- - Navigate down/up with `<C-n>`/`<C-p>`.
-- - Press `<Tab>` to show item's preview. `<Tab>` again goes back to items.
-- - Press `<S-Tab>` to show picker's info. `<S-Tab>` again goes back to items.
-- - Press `<CR>` to choose an item. The exact action depends on the picker: `files`
--   picker opens a selected file, `help` picker opens help page on selected tag.
--   To close picker without choosing an item, press `<Esc>`.
--
-- Example usage:
-- - `<Leader>ff` - *f*ind *f*iles; for best performance requires `ripgrep`
-- - `<Leader>fg` - *f*ind inside files (a.k.a. "to *g*rep"); requires `ripgrep`
-- - `<Leader>fh` - *f*ind *h*elp tag
-- - `<Leader>fr` - *r*esume latest picker
-- - `:h vim.ui.select()` - implemented with 'mini.pick'
--
-- See also:
-- - `:h MiniPick-overview` - overview of picker functionality
-- - `:h MiniPick-examples` - examples of common setups
-- - `:h MiniPick.builtin` and `:h MiniExtra.pickers` - available pickers;
--   Execute one either with Lua function, `:Pick <picker-name>` command, or
--   one of `<Leader>f` mappings defined in 'plugin/20_keymaps.lua'

-- Manage and expand snippets (templates for a frequently used text).
-- Typical workflow is to type snippet's (configurable) prefix and expand it
-- into a snippet session.
--
-- How to manage snippets:
-- - 'mini.snippets' itself doesn't come with preconfigured snippets. Instead there
--   is a flexible system of how snippets are prepared before expanding.
--   They can come from pre-defined path on disk, 'snippets/' directories inside
--   config or plugins, defined inside `setup()` call directly.
-- - This config, however, does come with snippet configuration:
--     - 'snippets/global.json' is a file with global snippets that will be
--       available in any buffer
--     - 'after/snippets/lua.json' defines personal snippets for Lua language
--     - 'friendly-snippets' plugin configured in 'plugin/40_plugins.lua' provides
--       a collection of language snippets
--
-- How to expand a snippet in Insert mode:
-- - If you know snippet's prefix, type it as a word and press `<C-j>`. Snippet's
--   body should be inserted instead of the prefix.
-- - If you don't remember snippet's prefix, type only part of it (or none at all)
--   and press `<C-j>`. It should show picker with all snippets that have prefixes
--   matching typed characters (or all snippets if none was typed).
--   Choose one and its body should be inserted instead of previously typed text.
--
-- How to navigate during snippet session:
-- - Snippets can contain tabstops - places for user to interactively adjust text.
--   Each tabstop is highlighted depending on session progression - whether tabstop
--   is current, was or was not visited. If tabstop doesn't yet have text, it is
--   visualized with special "ghost" inline text: • and ∎ by default.
-- - Type necessary text at current tabstop and navigate to next/previous one
--   by pressing `<C-l>` / `<C-h>`.
-- - Repeat previous step until you reach special final tabstop, usually denoted
--   by ∎ symbol. If you spotted a mistake in an earlier tabstop, navigate to it
--   and return back to the final tabstop.
-- - To end a snippet session when at final tabstop, keep typing or go into
--   Normal mode. To force end snippet session, press `<C-c>`.

-- Split and join arguments (regions inside brackets between allowed separators).
-- It uses Lua patterns to find arguments, which means it works in comments and
-- strings but can be not as accurate as tree-sitter based solutions.
-- Each action can be configured with hooks (like add/remove trailing comma).
-- Example usage:
-- - `gS` - toggle between joined (all in one line) and split (each on a separate
--   line and indented) arguments. It is dot-repeatable (see `:h .`).

-- Surround actions: add/delete/replace/find/highlight. Working with surroundings
-- is surprisingly common: surround word with quotes, replace `)` with `]`, etc.
-- This module comes with many built-in surroundings, each identified by a single
-- character. It searches only for surrounding that covers cursor and comes with
-- a special "next" / "last" versions of actions to search forward or backward
-- (just like 'mini.ai'). All text editing actions are dot-repeatable (see `:h .`).
--
-- Example usage (this may feel intimidating at first, but after practice it
-- becomes second nature during text editing):
-- - `saiw)` - *s*urround *a*dd for *i*nside *w*ord parenthesis (`)`)
-- - `sdf`   - *s*urround *d*elete *f*unction call (like `f(var)` -> `var`)
-- - `srb[`  - *s*urround *r*eplace *b*racket (any of [], (), {}) with padded `[`
-- - `sf*`   - *s*urround *f*ind right part of `*` pair (like bold in markdown)
-- - `shf`   - *s*urround *h*ighlight current *f*unction call
-- - `srn{{` - *s*urround *r*eplace *n*ext curly bracket `{` with padded `{`
-- - `sdl'`  - *s*urround *d*elete *l*ast quote pair (`'`)
-- - `vaWsa<Space>` - *v*isually select *a*round *W*ORD and *s*urround *a*dd
--                    spaces (`<Space>`)

-- Highlight and remove trailspace. Temporarily stops highlighting in Insert mode
-- to reduce noise when typing. Example usage:

end)

-- Track and reuse file system visits. Every file/directory visit is persistently
-- tracked on disk to later reuse: show in special frecency order, etc. It also
-- supports adding labels to visited paths to quickly navigate between them.
-- Example usage:
-- - `<Leader>fv` - find across all visits
-- - `<Leader>vv` / `<Leader>vV` - add/remove special "core" label to current file
-- - `<Leader>vc` / `<Leader>vC` - show files with "core" label; all or added within
--   current working directory
